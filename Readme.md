/************Credit Card*****************/

**General Objective**
In this project I have created an active credit card and a form to update the details to creditcard. 
I have used a reusable credit-card component. When we edit the form, the changes are updated in the creditcard. 
Since the CVV element is present in the backside of the credit card, you can see the card also flips accordingly.
I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also React for this project.

**Challenges faced**
I have done projects before in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This is my first React project. It was very tough for me to get started with React. But with the help of videos and informations in internet, I could finish it. Though the base for React depends on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, they way it is used is little different. I red through a lot of documentations and did small projects in my local machine to understand better.
The main challenge I faced is how to use the form in React Bootstrap. To add a basic form is simple but then I spend a lot of time in figuring out how to split columns in React bootstrap.
